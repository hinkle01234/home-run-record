   Baseball has been played for <strong>over 100 years</strong>!
   Barry Lamar Bonds was born on July 24, 1964, in Riverside, California,
   to baseball player Bobby Bonds. He made history by setting the
   single-season and career records for home runs. Hank Aaron was born
   February 5,1934, in Mobile, Alabama. He was the third of eight
   children. Baseball player Babe Ruth was born on February 6, 1895,
   in Baltimore, Maryland. Over the course of his career, Ruth went on
   to break baseball's most important slugging records, including most
   years leading a league in home runs, most total bases in a season,
   and highest slugging percentage for a season. Born on May 6, 1931,
   in Westfield, Alabama, Willie Mays began his professional baseball
   career in the Negro Leagues before joining the New York Giants in
   1951. Celebrated for his superb all-around play, he was twice named
   MVP and finished among the all-time leaders in home runs and hits.
